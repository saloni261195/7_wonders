			Commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal stands
			 on the southern bank of the Yamuna River. The mausoleum is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India" and remains 
			 as one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a symbol of India’s rich history.<br/><br/>

			Regarded by many as the best example of the Mughal architecture, it is a perfect blend combining elements from Islamic, Persian,
			 Ottoman Turkish as well as Indian architectural styles.<br/><br/>

			The famed mausoleum complex of white domed marble of the Taj Mahal actually is an integrated complex of many structures. The
			 construction began around 1632 and was completed in about 22 years, in 1653, employing around 20,000 artisans and craftsmen
			  throughout the empire. The construction was entrusted to a board of architects, the chief architect probably being Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.<br/><br/>

			 Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, was in love with Mumtaz Mahal, his dear wife. She was a Muslim Persian princess and he was the son of the Mughal Emperor Jehangir and grandson of Akbar the Great. It was at the age of 14 that he met Mumtaz and fell in love with her. Five years later in the year 1612, they got married.
			Mumtaz Mahal, an inseparable companion of Shah Jahan, died in 1631, while giving birth to their 14th child. It was in the memory of his beloved wife that Shah Jahan built a magnificent monument as a tribute to her, which we today know as the "Taj Mahal". The construction of Taj Mahal started in the year 1631. Masons, stonecutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome-builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from Central Asia and Iran, and it took approximately 22 years to build what we see today. An epitome of love, it made use of the services of 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. The monument was built entirely out of white marble, which was brought in from all over India and central Asia. After an expenditure of approximately 32 million rupees, Taj Mahal was finally completed in the year 1653.<br/><br/>

			It was soon after the completion of Taj Mahal that Shah Jahan was deposed by his own son Aurangzeb and was put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. Shah Jahan, himself also, lies entombed in this mausoleum along with his wife.<br/>
