			Christ the Redeemer  is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by the Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with the French engineer Albert Caquot. It is 30 metres (98 ft) tall, not including its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal, and its arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.<br/><br/>

			The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio. As a symbol of Brazilian Christianity, the statue has become an icon for Rio de Janeiro and Brazil. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, and was constructed between 1922 and 1931

			 The statue was first conceived in 1921 when a campaign to gather funds from the Catholic Church was held. The idea for the statue came when the country was to celebrate 100 years of independence. Donations were not received to build the statue until about ten years later. The first person commissioned to design the statue was Carlos Oswaldo. His vision for the statue was for Christ to be carrying a cross, holding a globe in his hands, and standing over a pedestal that was supposed to represent the world. Later, the public of Rio thought that Christ with open arms would be the best representation of the city. Building for the statue began in 1926 and was completed in 1931, five years later.<br/><br/>
			 The statue was not sculpted in Brazil ; it was instead sculpted in France by a sculptor whose name was Paul Landowski. The pieces of the stature were then shipped over to Brazil where they were taken up to the top of the Corcovado Mountain by train and assembled. The pieces were made out of soapstone. This material was chosen because of its resistance to weather and cracking. The statue, when completed, became the largest art deco monument in the world.
